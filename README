Hey hey! My first Haskell package!

This thing will let you build all of the webcat-related code in one easy to use nugget.

  runhaskell Setup configure --with-compiler=ghc-6.4.2 --user
  # I think this is a suitable alternative
  cabal configure

And then you want to build the package. Do this every time you make changes.

  cabal build

Yay!
